# 👋 Hi, I'm Danilo

I’m an Eng. Manager / Senior Software Engineer working across mobile, web, open source, and AI.  
I spent many years at **Automattic**, the company behind WordPress.com, WooCommerce, and Gravatar, where I worked on the WordPress mobile apps, WordPress core, and a variety of open source projects.  
After that, I joined **Tumblr** as an Engineering Manager before moving to **JLG Group**.

📍 Most of what I do lives on [danilo.blog](https://danilo.blog)
